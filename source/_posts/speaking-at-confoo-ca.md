I recently had the pleasure to hear that I would be speaking at the [ConFoo](http://confoo.ca/) conference. This is a great opportunity for me as I'll finally be able to meet a few US-based guys from the PHP community that I have only ever met virtually.

Besides that the conference itself also looks great, and covers an insane amount of topics with almost [150 sessions](http://confoo.ca/en/2011/session) in 3 days, and boatloads of [speakers](http://confoo.ca/en/2011/speaker). I will give two talks, one about JavaScript Scopes, Events and other complications to try and illustrate why people really ought to learn JavaScript better. The second will be about frontend web performance, i.e. how to perform well in the browser. It will include a short overview of old classics and then a couple new topics such as the Web Performance APIs and some more advanced optimizations that are hopefully not too widespread like CSS selectors and DOM reflow issues.

So I hope to see you all in Montreal for what promises to be a huge conference.
