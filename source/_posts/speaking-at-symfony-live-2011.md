I have the pleasure to announce that I will be speaking at the upcoming [Symfony Live](http://www.symfony-live.com/paris) conference (Paris edition).

I've been working with and on Symfony2 for a few months already, both in my spare time and at the office - thanks to [Liip](http://liip.ch/), my employer, I can work on Symfony2 patches during office hours :) - and I must say it's really nice to work with already, so if you don't have time to check it out yourself you should come, and if you do have time, then you should still come to share your experiences with other users or newcomers, I'm sure we'll have a great time.

It should be relevant to anyone with any sort of interest in PHP frameworks by the way, since the brand new Symfony2 framework should be released in its final version during the conference and several sessions will be focused on it. It's a rewrite from scratch so no symfony1 knowledge is required, but if you use symfony1 already you should really come to learn about the framework's future.

Now with all that said, my talk will not actually be about frameworks, Symfony or PHP! It'll be about JavaScript and why you should learn it, which I'll try to demonstrate by talking about Events, Scopes and other little things that most PHP devs like to ignore but should not. JavaScript code is present in most sites, and most PHP developers will have to write some sooner or later, so you might as well learn how to do it right, and avoid creating an unmaintainable mess in the frontend, now that we've gotten out of the PHP-spaghetti era.

You can find the full schedule on the [conference website](http://www.symfony-live.com/paris/schedule), and don't forget about the last day (hack day), I'm sure that will be an excellent opportunity to talk to people that have been using Sf2 for months, or just ask more questions to speakers you missed during the tighter schedule of the conference days.

See you in Paris!
