One of the barriers to convert users into contributors in an open-source projects is that many people have no idea where to start. They are usually scared to take on large tasks because they are not comfortable enough with the code-base. Yet I think there are ways you can help them as a project maintainer.

One good way that I found to fix this is to tag specific issues that are a good starting point for new contributors. However I think the practice would be even more effective if more projects did the same way, so that people know to look for it.

The way I do it is using a custom <span style="display: inline-block; padding:1px 3px; font-weight:bold; background:#e2ec4d; color:#616600;">Easy Pick</span> label to indicate issues on GitHub that are just that. Easy to pick up tasks, either because they are small in scope, or just don't involve much in-depth knowledge of the project.

The result of this is a much clearer view of issues. On the Composer project for example if you go in the issues tab and then [filter by "Easy Pick"](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues?labels=Easy+Pick&page=1&state=open), you end up with 14 issues listed instead of 170. A much more manageable amount to look at and pick from, and you are empowered by the knowledge that those should all be reasonably easy to work out.

I have also created this label in the [Symfony2](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues?labels=Easy+Pick&page=1&state=open) issues a while back. As you see both use the same wording and the same yellow that's one of the default colors on GitHub.

I would love to see this spread because I have already seen it bring in a few new contributors. So if you feel like encouraging people to join in on your project give it a try. And if you feel like giving back this week-end, browse the issues of the projects you use and enjoy. See if you find anything you can help them with.
