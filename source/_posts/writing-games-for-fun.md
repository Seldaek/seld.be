GitHub organized a [Game Off](https://github.com/blog/1303-github-game-off) - or a game competition - back in November. The contest ran for a month and its only limitations were that the game runs in a browser and relate somewhat to forking/cloning/pushing/pulling. And I am here to tell you that no matter what kind of programmer you are, you should take part in such contests!

I am hardly a game developer. I do spend most of my time writing web things in both PHP and JS, and I had not worked on a game in at least 5 years. This sounded like a good opportunity for a little change. It is easy to get stuck in what you do once you do it well, but just like I enjoy playing with other languages every now and then, working on a different product in a familiar language also offers interesting challenges. Game mechanics, canvas rendering and more visual programming are all things that I am not used to work with.

Long story short, I came up with this small simple [Split](http://seld.be/split/) game that I invite you to [try out](http://seld.be/split/). It was a lot of fun to write, and given the 1 month deadline you do not have time to mess around and let feature creep take over. You have to get things done fast. It is a great exercise both for programming skills and time management/prioritization.

If you are interested in seeing other entries to the contest, there is a [full list](http://pkukielka.github.com/ggo12-viewer/) available but it does contain quite a lot of incomplete and barely playable games. Having gone through most of the list, I can recommend those few games that I enjoyed, mostly because they went out of the beaten path and are trying something new: [Echo](http://eleventigers.github.com/echo/), [Radiance](http://pkukielka.github.com/radiance/), [Mazeoid](http://www.duncanbeevers.com/mazeoid/) and [Release Cycle](http://www.release-cycles.com/).

Mozilla is running a [similar contest](https://gameon.mozilla.org/en-US/) until February, so there is your chance to get your hands dirty over the Christmas holidays. You have nothing to lose, and building games is both fun and challenging!
