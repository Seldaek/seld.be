Here is a short update on the conferences I will attend in the coming months, in case you want to meet or if you are just looking for a good one to attend:

Next month I am very happy to have the chance to visit Tunisia for the first time and go speak about [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) at the [Symfony Tunisia](http://symfony-tunisia.com/) event. It will also be the first time I give a talk in French, which freaks me out a bit since I am so used to speaking about technical matters in English. You can therefore expect a bastardized language known as Frenglish.

Right after that is the first [SymfonyCon](http://warsaw2013.symfony.com/) happening in Europe, which will be in Warsaw, Poland. And I hear it is almost sold out so in case you were thinking of going hurry up and grab a ticket now.

In January I will head back to my mother nation of Belgium (insert "while it is still a country" joke) for two events: first I will speak at [PHPBenelux](http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2014/) about web application monitoring with [Heka](http://hekad.readthedocs.org/). Then the weekend after there is [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2014/) where I hope I can also meet a few people from outside the PHP community.
