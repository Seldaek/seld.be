It's lame catchy title day, a more appropriate one would be "Think for yourself", but I want to get my point across.

This is a general purpose idea of course, I don't think there is any case in your life where you shouldn't think for yourself, but this particular post is about programming.

I just read someone (and I won't name names, it's not relevant) that was pondering using [Dwoo](http://dwoo.org) or [Twig](http://www.twig-project.org) in his CMS, who ended up picking Twig because, and I quote: *"but twig says they're better than dwoo so ..."*. Now I sincerely couldn't care less if someone decides to use something else over Dwoo - which I'm working on in case you wouldn't know. It's your own choice, and even I wouldn't say Dwoo is the best choice for every damned purpose out there.

What bothers me though, is that obviously the guy read Fabien Potencier's article about php [template engines](http://fabien.potencier.org/article/34/templating-engines-in-php), which was obviously not so much of an objective post, but that has already been discussed so let's not go to deep into it. Anyway, the guy most likely read it, and all it says about Dwoo to dismiss it is *"Unfortunately, Dwoo has no sandbox feature and its core is not flexible enough"*. So.. out of this most enlightening comment, you decide to trust Fabien and just assume Twig is better? I just don't get it.

So again, please, just think for yourself.
