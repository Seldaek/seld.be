My blog was always based on some home-grown CMS I built during my studies in.. *checks CV* 2007-2008. 

This was mostly fine but it had no markdown support and it was one more server to manage. I would like to try and write some more content here again so 
I figured I should get this sorted out as a first step, because writing text in plain HTML is kind of a pain.

So here we are, here's my new website! It's built with [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.com) and hosted with GitHub pages for convenience.

And because it's 2022 and I wanted to play a bit with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), there's a <a class="toggle-dark cursor-pointer dark:hidden inline">dark mode</a> <a class="toggle-dark cursor-pointer dark:inline hidden">light mode</a> too of course ðŸ˜Ž.

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
