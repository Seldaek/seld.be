Slippy is a HTML Presentation library written with jQuery, it takes a html file in and plays it in any browser.

It is optimal for programming-related talks since it includes a syntax highlighter and is very easy to use since it's just standard html markup with a few classes to enable specific functions.

If you are making a talk about Javascript, it can even execute your code samples live and displays alert() boxes nicely instead of using the ugly browser dialog, which -I tried it today- works quite well to prove your point interactively.

You can find the sources on [github](http://github.com/Seldaek/slippy), view the [example slide deck](http://slides.seld.be/?file=2010-05-30+Example.html) which includes some documentation or view the slides for the small talk I gave today about *Javascript Events* on my Slippy [slide repository](http://slides.seld.be/).

Obviously feedback is very much welcome and even though it's not perfect yet, I hope it'll be useful to others. More docs and styling fixes (the dark grey background wasn't too visible on a projector, my bad) should come soon as I have more talks planned, and the slide repository page will receive some love as well when I have time.
